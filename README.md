## alot..

alot.[website](http://alotalot.surge.sh/)  A peer to peer application that allows individuals to lease their parking spaces/lots and driveways on a short-term basis to other individuals, particularly during high traffic times(e.g. sporting events, concerts,street fairs etc.) 

## Journey.

This was truly a unique project; it stretched our team (Majed Tarabein, Ashtin Latting and Samuel Shobowale). 
We not only had to put our full MERN knowledge to use, we also had come up with a creative viable product.

This was certainly different from our previous projects where we worked individually, and the project ideas were provided to us.

We encountered so many bumps and bruises, the biggest challenge of all was the frontend.

### `Technical Components`

Our alot. application is underpinned by the Full MERN stack: Mongo Database, Express Javascript, NodeJS and ReactJS. 

**Back-End:**

Our back-end is a Node, Express and Mongoose API. It includes three models: Listing, Review and User. In addition, we have implemented CRUD on the relevant models.
